Functionality of the Programs

Task 1: Factorial Calculation

This program calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion.
The function factorial(n) is defined as follows:
  If n is less than 2, it returns 1 (base case).
Otherwise, it recursively multiplies n by factorial(n-1).
The user enters an integer, which is passed to the factorial() function, and the result is displayed.

Task 2: Math Module for Calculations

This program takes a floating-point number as input and performs three mathematical calculations using the math module:
  1. Square Root (math.sqrt(num)) – Computes the square root of the number.
  2. Logarithm (math.log(num)) – Computes the natural logarithm (log base e).
  3. Sine Value (math.sin(num)) – Computes the sine of the number (in radians).
The results are printed on the screen.
